## Using multiple f-spy cameras in one scene

1. Best to use the exact same origin point across all views
2. Ensure lines are longer and further apart as possible
3. Use 3D guides (box, floor etc.) to improve alignment
4. Set reference distance, for at least one of the axis (if you can guess the distance more or less)
